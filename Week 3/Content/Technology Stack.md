## What is it?
The technologies we choose to use for our project.

More concretely, we mean things such as:
- Operating System
- Programming language
- Frameworks
- Databases
- External software
- And so forth

#### Monolith projects
The technology stack here is straight forward: we use one technology stack for the whole project

#### Microarchitecture projects
Here we can vary technology stacks for every micro architecture depends on what are the best fits.
If we are trying to implement an AI microarchitecture, it'll be good to use python as part of the stack.
