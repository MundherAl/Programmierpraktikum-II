#### Vertical scaling
- solve performance issues by upgrading hardware
#### Horizontal scaling
- solve issues by duplicating software on multiple computers

## Micro vs Monolith Architecture
- Monolith architectures scale all their components equally. This can be a disadvantage if a component does not need to be scaled.
- Microarchitectures on the other hand can scale components individually.
