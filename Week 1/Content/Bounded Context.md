## Motivation
- We know that concepts can change meaning according to context.
- This can lead to problems in using ubiquitous language.
- Solution:
## Bounded context
- We may have a concept, say, "book" that means different things in different concepts.
- We therefore set boundaries as to what "book" means. A bounded context.
- A book can be a search result in a database. A book can also be an object with an author, summary, etc...
