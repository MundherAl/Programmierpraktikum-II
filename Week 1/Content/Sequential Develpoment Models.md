 ## What is a development model?
 A development moodel provides:
 - A development plan
 - A solution for the problem
 - A logical and timely plan for the process
 - (Sometimes) the description of events and roles.

Problems with models:
- they lead to "dogmatism", a sort of checklist checking.
- Tunnel vision.
Having a model is better than no model, but we need to be aware of how models limit us.

Solution:
- If your model is getting in the way, change it!
