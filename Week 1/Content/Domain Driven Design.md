## What is it good for?
- Applications or projects that have high domain complexity
---
## Ubiquitous Language
- A language that both developers and domain experts understand
- Is to be used in spoken communication, emails, texts, â€¦
- Is also to be used when naming methods, classes and such.

##### Some obstacles
- **Missing concept knowledge**: relatively harmless problem, software developers can fill missing knowledge.
- **Different interpretations**: domain concepts can have different interpretations in different contexts. This problem has two variants:
	- Concepts can have different meanings for different domains that might intertwine
		- Example: booking in event management, booking in bookkeeping
	- Some everyday speech concepts can have important different meanings.
		- Example: unique in math, unique in everyday language
- **Translation errors**: some false friends can cause problems.
	- Example: gift in English versus gift in German

##### Some remedies
- **Avoid using synonyms**. Example: always use the word user instead of customer, buyer, ...
- **Study domain concepts properly**.
- **Develop a glossary**.
