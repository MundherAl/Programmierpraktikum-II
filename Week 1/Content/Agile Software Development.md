Now we know that we should implement the waterfall model only if the specifications are well understood. This is however more often not the case. Enter:
# Agile Development
## What is it about?
- In agile development, software development is a learning process
- Software development is also a production process. There is always a product at the end of the process
We assume that we have the least amount of information on day one, therefore we cannot always make optimal design choices. The solution is:
$$\textrm{a quick feedback loop!}$$
The idea is to have a feedback loop that is as quick as possible to help us with information gathering so we can adjust our development to reality. In order for this to succeed:
- we need a functioning feedback loop. This means more communication with software users
- We need to always be ready to respond to specification changes, even if our software is almost finished!
- We also need to make sure out software is maintanable.
