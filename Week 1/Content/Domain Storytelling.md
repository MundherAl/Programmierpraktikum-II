## Why do we need it?
For many cool reasons!
- Gaining familiarity with the domain
- Developing ubiquitous language
- Finding solutions and bounded contexts
- Finding specifications and knowledge gaps
- Clears up misunderstandings

##  How?
Tell a story by presenting it visually:
- Set actors (admins, users, platform, server)
- Set Working-objects (Contracts, E-Mails, Books, prices, etcâ€¦)
	- Try to use icons that are representative of the objects
- Set Activities (Signing, purchasing, etc...)
	- Arrow to show interaction or activity
- Use annotations:
	- Show alternatives
	- Descriptions and explanations
	- Assumptions
	- Other important informations
