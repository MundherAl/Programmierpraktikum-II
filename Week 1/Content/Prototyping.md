## Prototypes are helpful!
- They make discussions with field experts easy. Specifications become more concrete and less abstract
- Prototypes can test if our approach to a problem works
- We can build prototypes to compare approaches to problems
- Prototypes help gain basic field experience with frameworks or libraries that are new to us

## Horizontal prototypes
- Used in the early stages of analysis, they give a broad a view of an application
- Example: Menus, buttons, dummy sample reports, etc
- No detailed implementation, just a draft of how feature sets will work together
- Horizontal prototypes are excellent material to present to stakeholders and clients!

## Vertical prototypes
- More technical than horizontal prototypes
- They focus on implementation specific features
- They reflect near-exact functions of end-product features
- Mostly used as proof-of-concept, good demonstration for stakeholders that an application actually works


> [!NOTE] Prototypes as a basis for development
> If we intend to use a prototype as a basis for development, then it must fulfill the specified quality requirements
