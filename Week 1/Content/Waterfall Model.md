## Waterfall model
- Divide the project in sequential phases.
- Each phases produces a product (Artifacts, documents, ...)
- Put a check mark on the phase's goal.
- A new phase begins only when the previous phase is concluded.

### Phases:#
- Planing: project plan, specifications, calcuations
- Definition: system specifications, GUI model, user manual
- Draft: software model (e.g. in UML)
- Implementation: code artifcates
- Testing: report
- Operating and maintenance

## Customer phase
##### Project specifications:
- Specify the problem from an expert perspective
- Describe *what* should be developed
- **Don't** describe the solution
- Generalize and keep specifying to a minimum
- Can be used as a proposal!

##### System specifications:
- Specify the solution
- Describe how the project specifications should be implemented
- Is usually the basis for an order placement!

## Developer phase
- ##### Drafting
- ##### Implementation

## Advantages
- Is a simple model
- Project progress is transparent
- Product will be well documented
	- Process uses documentation as a basis
	- Documentation will be a product, so it must be of high quality.

## Disadvantages
- Doesn't optimize usage of capacity (Developers don't do much in the early phases)
- Clear phase goals are not always accomplished
- Alternative solutions are discarded early
- Expenditure is bigger through documentation
- Not flexible in the case of request changes
- Reverting code is often needed

## Facit
A strict waterfall model is not a great practice! But it is a good model for embedded systems or applications where security is important.
